* Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

* Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.


3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

* Use `sample_values` for the y values.

* Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

* Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.
